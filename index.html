                <h1>Birds are bountiful in Baltimore City!</h1>
                <p>Baltimore City and it's surrounding regions are a haven for birds.
                    For many migratory birds, it's waterways and rolling fields lined with brush and forest are an
                    welcome refuge on thier long journey.
                    Baltimore's many park spaces are year-round homes to generations of woodpeckers and songbirds.
                    Even large birds like hawks, owls and vultures have taken up residence and call Baltimore's urban
                    landscape home. </p>

            Had I wings to fly how far would I wander? How high?
            <br>
            It is tasked to earthbound souls like mine
            <br>
            to worry over flight&mdash;
            <br>
            or falling.
            <br>
            A parrow sings the knowing
            <br>
            a feather's lift is faith enough.
